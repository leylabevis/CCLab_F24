                <h3 class="red">Habitat:</h3>
                <p>Luminessea can be found in the deep waters off the coast of Southern China, though sometimes she enjoys venturing closer to the surface out of curiosity.</p>

   <h3 class="blue">Appearance:</h3>
   <p>Luminessea is a semi-transparent, color-changing sea snake. She only changes color when she feels threatened. However, if you get close enough to touch her, she is quite ticklish and will react. She is about one foot long and her body is composed of multiple circular sections which only appear disconnected because her body is transparent.</p>
