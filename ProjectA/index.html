                <h3 class="red">Habitat:</h3>
                <p>Luminessea can be found in the warm, coastal waters off the South China coast, though sometimes she enjoys venturing closer to the surface out of curiosity.</p>

   <h3 class="blue">Appearance:</h3>
   <p>Luminessea is a semi-transparent, color-changing sea snake. She only changes color when she feels threatened. She also uses this as a self-defense mechanism, as her transparent body and color-changing nature allow her to camoflage herself around perceived threats. However, if one gets close enough to touch her, she is quite ticklish and will react. She is about one foot long and her body is composed of multiple circular sections which only appear disconnected because her body is transparent.</p>

            <p><span class="yellow">What we know so far about this creature:</span> Luminessea is a very shy creature. Coupled with the fact that she's mostly transparent, she wasn't discovered until recently. Her behavior is quite mild, reacting only to outside disruptions. Her defense mechanism of camoflage allows her to move between shallow coastal waters and deeper waters with ease. She has a playful personality despite being so shy, as she seems to enjoy staying in areas with lots of colorful bubbles. In addition, her playfulness shines through when she turns herself vibrant colors.</p>
            <p><span class="yellow">Guidelines for interaction: </span>First, explore her habitat by moving your mouse around on the screen and seeing if Luminessea currently prefers shallow or deep water. Although Luminessea is shy, she loves getting tickled. If you announce your presence in her environment with a mouse click or two, you'll be able to see her color-changing abilities. Once you've established yourself to be friendly, go ahead and pet her, she loves to laugh!</p>
